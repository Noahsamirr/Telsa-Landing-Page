        <h2>Cybertruck</h2>
        <p><br>The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery electric light-duty truck announced by Tesla, Inc.
             in 2019. Three models have been announced, with EPA range estimates of 400â€“800 kilometers (250â€“500 mi) and an estimated 0â€“100 km/h (0â€“62 mph) time of 2.9â€“6.5 seconds, depending on the model.
            </p>

        <p>The stated goal of Tesla in developing the Cybertruck is to provide a sustainable energy substitute for the roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered trucks sold per day in the United States</p>
        <p>The proposed truck uses self-leveling suspension which compensates for variable load and some models feature all-wheel drive. 
            The company states that other standard features will include on-board power inverters for supplying both 120 and 240-volt electricity, allowing use of power tools without a portable generator. 
            An air compressor for powering pneumatic tools is included. The exterior stainless steel sheet-metal is said to be bullet-resistant.
             All vehicles are also planned to come with Tesla Autopilot, and they are planned to have the hardware capabilities for fully autonomous operation. 
            As of 2019, Musk indicated that there would be a solar roof option which would add 15 miles of range per day.</p>

        <h2>Model S</h2>
    
        <p>The Tesla Model S is a battery-powered liftback car produced by Tesla, Inc.
             It was introduced on June 22, 2012 and is positioned as Tesla's flagship model.
            In 2013, the Model S became the first electric car to top the monthly new-car-sales ranking in any country, leading twice in Norway, in September and December 2013 and in Denmark in December 2015.
            Sales passed 250,000 units in September 2018.
            The Model S was the top-selling plug-in electric car worldwide in 2015 and 2016, although it was later surpassed by the Model 3.       
            In an early review of the Model S, Consumer Reports declared, "This car performs better than anything we've ever tested before.
            </p>

        <p>Let me repeat that: Not just the best electric car, but the best car. It does just about everything really, really well.
            In 2019, Motor Trend named the 2013 Tesla Model S the ultimate "Car of the Year" over the magazine's entire 70-year history. 
            It received a refresh in June 2021.<br>A bold new approach gives you a true connection to Model S, offering better steering feel and unobstructed views of your dash and the road ahead. 
            Tap the brake and Model S automatically selects the correct direction to start your trip.</p>

        <h2>Model X</h2>
        <p>The Tesla Model X is a battery electric mid-size luxury crossover produced by Tesla, Inc. since 2015.
             Developed from the full-sized sedan platform of the Tesla Model S, the vehicle is notable in that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access.</p>
        <p>The Model X has an EPA size class as an SUV, and shares around 30 percent of its content with the Model S, half of the originally planned 60 percent, and weighs about 10 percent more. 
            Both the Model X and Model S are produced at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California. 
            The prototype was unveiled at Tesla's design studios in Hawthorne, California on February 9, 2012. 
            First deliveries of the Model X began in September 2015.
             After one full year on the market, in 2016, the Model X ranked seventh among the world's best-selling plug-in cars.</p>
